# Solid Security Research
## About this repo
The following is a github repository for open source research that I completed during my NLP research internship at a startup called Solid Security (a now defunct company)

Within each of the folders are a readme detailing how to execute and use said code.  The code and methods should be documented well enough to understand, but for a high level overview of the project, please refer to the [paper](https://github.com/SolidSecurity/Solid-Spintax-Specification) I wrote detailing the system.

My role in this project was to do white paper write-ups, coding the project, expand on the concept, and researching NLP methods to make it feasible, while under minimal guidance of Solid Security.

## The concept

The concept behind this project, in summary is to have a leak mitigation system where text can be protected from copying by making the text itself uniquely identifiable, through permutations.  A step by step explanation can be seen in the presentation shown [here](https://github.com/Fuehnix/Solid-Security-Research/blob/master/Papers%20and%20Presentations/Presentation.pdf)
