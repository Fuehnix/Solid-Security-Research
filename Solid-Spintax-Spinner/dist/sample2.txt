This event was the Tending the Flame: The Concert Band Tradition concert presented by SWIC's music department, featuring Dr. Robert Jordan, and directed by Ed Jacobs. It was
performed in the Main Complex Theatre at SWIC's Belleville Campus on May {11|eleven} th 2017. As the
director explained near the {beginning|start} of the concert, the {purpose|goal} {of this|of the} concert was to "tend the flame" of tradition. {This means|What this means is} that {instead of|rather than} "worshipping the ashes" of the {great|fantastic} composers
of history, {we should|we must|we've got to} keep their legacy alive by playing {their works|the works of theirs}. The songs chosen were: the
I, II, and III movements of First Suite in E Flat by Gustav Holst, {the I, II|II, the I}, and IV movements of
the Peer Gynt Suite {1|one} by Edvard Grieg, Der Alte Brummbär by Julius Fučík, Children's March:
"Over the Hills and Far Away" by Percy Aldridge Grainger, Variations on a Korean Folk Song by John Barnes Chance, Prelude, Siciliano, and Rondo, by Malcolm Arnold, Shepherd's Hey!,
by Percy Aldridge Grainger, and The Stars and Stripes Forever! by John Phillip Sousa.
For {this|this particular} concert, I {would|will} say that the relatively small size of the SWIC theatre created a
much more intimate and {personal|private} environment {than what|compared to what} you {would|will} {experience|go through} at a symphony hall {or|and} stadium. I remember hearing some people comment on how they liked the intimacy of
SWIC's music events on {my way|the way of mine} {out of|from} the concert, so {I am|I'm} probably in the minority with that opinion. {Nevertheless|Nevertheless|However|Nonetheless|But}, it {wasn't|was not} {enough|adequate} to take away from the music, {which|that} I genuinely
enjoyed.
{The first|The very first|The initial} movement, Chaconne, starts off beautifully with the tuba {and the|as well as the|along with the} {unique|distinctive|one of a kind} {sound|sounds} of the euphonium, later accompanied by the {rest|majority|remainder} of the brass, then the {rest of|remainder of} the band. The form
is {clearly|obviously} a theme and variations, as the theme is played {repeatedly|frequently} throughout the movement, {each|every|every single} time with different instrument combinations.
{The second|The next} movement, Intermezzo, begins with the reed instruments harmonizing together. {There are|You will find|You can find|You'll find} {three|3} different themes throughout this movement, with the reed instruments
really standing {out|out there} in each theme to me. Throughout the movement, I {couldn't|could not} help but think of
how Intermezzo's main theme reminded me of a section of Hedwig's Theme from Harry Potter, but without the string instruments.
The {third|final} movement, March, sounds {just as|just like|in the same way} the {name|title} implies, like a marching sound. It
starts off with {a series of|a number of|a compilation of} high trills by the woodwinds followed by the brass contrasting it with {low|lower} notes. After the bass drum thuds, it {starts|begins|will begin} to sound {much more|a lot more|far more|considerably more} like an orderly marching
song, almost {as if|like} the bass drum was commanding the band to get in line.
{I can|I|I will|I surely|I definitely} say with {absolute|complete} sincerity that I {really|actually|truly} enjoyed this piece. It was {very|extremely|quite} {refreshing|relaxing} to
hear {such familiar music {live|fresh} and up close|up close and such familiar music {live|fresh}}. The relaxing nature of {the first|the very first|the earliest} movement, Morning,
also helped to relieve {some of|several of} the awkwardness I {initially|originally|in the beginning} felt. I {completely|fully} understand now
what my professor was {saying|thinking} about {people|folks|individuals} {who|that} get really into {their music|the music of theirs}, when I {saw|watched} the oboe player in the front play {his solo|the solo of his} with {passion and skill|skill and passion}. {There is|There's} {no doubt|little doubt} that the oboe and flute
were leading this movement, and they did {a fantastic|an excellent|an awesome} job doing it.
