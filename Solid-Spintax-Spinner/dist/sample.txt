director {explained|discussed|revealed} {near|close to} the {beginning|start} {of the|on the|belonging to the} concert, the {purpose|objective|goal} {of this|of the} concert {was to|ended up being to|would be to} "tend the flame" of tradition. {This means that|Which means that|Which means} {instead of|rather than} "worshipping the ashes" {of the|of} {great|terrific|fantastic|superb} composers
of {history|the historical past|times past}, {we should|we must|we've got to} {keep|maintain|hold} {their {legacy|history}|the {legacy|history} of theirs} {alive|still living|living} by {playing|actively playing|enjoying} {their {works|functions|performs}|the {works|functions|performs} of theirs}. The songs {chosen|selected|picked} were: the

For {this|this particular|this specific} concert, I {would|will} {say that|claim that|declare that} the {relatively|fairly|reasonably} {small|little|tiny} {size|dimensions|sizing} {of the|on the} SWIC theatre {created|produced|developed} a
{much more|a lot more|far more|considerably more} {intimate|personal|close} {and|as well as|and also} {personal|private|individual} {environment|surroundings|ecosystem} {than what|compared to what} you {would|will} {experience|go through|suffer from} {at|with} a symphony hall {or|or even|or perhaps} stadium. I {remember|recall|can remember|have a good memory of} {hearing|listening to|experiencing} {some people|a lot of people|some individuals} comment on {how they|the way they} {liked|appreciated|enjoyed} the intimacy of
SWIC's music {events|functions|gatherings} on {my {way|means|method}|the {way|means|method} of mine} {out of|from} the concert, {so|therefore|hence|thus|for this reason} {I am|I'm} {probably|likely|in all probability} {in|inside} the minority with {that|that particular|that kind of} {opinion|viewpoint|impression}. {Nevertheless|Nevertheless|However|Nonetheless|But}, it {wasn't|was not} {enough|adequate|sufficient} to {take away|ease|relieve} {from|coming from|grown in} the music, {which I|that I} genuinely
{enjoyed|appreciated|liked}.
{The first|The very first|The initial} {movement|campaign|drive}, Chaconne, {starts off|begins|kicks off} {beautifully|attractively|magnificently} {with the|with all the|from the} tuba {and the|as well as the|along with the} {unique|distinctive|one of a kind} {sound|sounds|sound quality} {of the|on the|around the} euphonium, later accompanied by the {rest|majority|remainder} {of the|on the|belonging to the} brass, {then|subsequently} {the rest of the|the remainder of the|all of the other} band. The form
is {clearly|plainly} {a theme|a design} {and|as well as|and also} {variations|variants|modifications}, {as the|since the|because the} {theme|design} is played {repeatedly|in} {throughout the|through the entire|all through the} {movement|motion|activity|action}, {each time|every time|whenever} with {different|various|several} instrument {combinations|mixtures|combos}.
{The second|The next} {movement|campaign|drive}, Intermezzo, {begins|starts} {with the|together with the|along with the} reed {instruments|tools|devices} harmonizing {together|collectively|alongside one another}. {There are|You will find|You can find|You'll find} {three|3} {different|diverse|distinct} {themes|themes or templates|wordpress themes} {throughout|through} this {movement|motion|activity|action}, {with the|using the|while using} reed instruments
{really|seriously|honestly} {standing|positioned|standing upright} {out|out there} {in|inside|throughout} {each|every|each and every|every single} {theme|design} {to me|in my experience}. {Throughout the|Through the entire|All through the} {movement|motion|activity|action}, I {couldn't|could not} {help|assist} but {think|consider|contemplate} of
{how|exactly how|just how} Intermezzo's {main|primary|key} {theme|design} reminded me of {a section|a department|a place} of Hedwig's Theme {from|coming from|out of} Harry Potter, but {without the|minus the|but without the} string {instruments|tools|devices}.
{The third|The 3rd} {movement|campaign|drive}, March, {sounds|seems|appears} {just as|just like|in the same way} the {name|title|term} {implies|suggests|seems to indicate}, {like|such as|say for example} a marching {sound|audio}. It
{starts off|begins|kicks off} with {a series of|a number of|a compilation of} {high|higher} trills {by the|near the|next to the} woodwinds {followed by|and then|in addition to} the brass {contrasting|different|diverse} it with {low|lower|very low} {notes|paperwork}. {After the|As soon as the|Once the} bass drum thuds, it {starts|begins|will begin} to {sound|seem} {much more|far more|a lot more|considerably more} like {an orderly|an organized|a well-kept} marching
song, {almost|pretty much|practically|nearly} as {if|in case} the bass drum was commanding the band {to get|to buy|to choose} {in|within|inside} {line|collection|series}.
{I can|I will|I|I surely|I definitely} {say|point out|state} with {absolute|complete|total} {sincerity|truthfulness} {that I|which I} {really|actually|truly} {enjoyed|liked|appreciated} {this|the} {piece|portion|chunk}. {It was|It has been|It's} {very|extremely|quite} {refreshing|rejuvenating|relaxing} to
{hear|pick up|audibly hear} {such|these} {familiar|common|recognizable} music {live|living|fresh} {and|also|plus} up {close|near|close up}. The {relaxing|soothing|tranquil} {nature|dynamics|design} {of the|of} {first|very first|initial} {movement|campaign|drive}, Morning,
{also|additionally|likewise} {helped|aided|served} to {relieve|alleviate} {some of|several of} the awkwardness I {initially|originally|in the beginning} {felt|sensed|believed}. I {completely|entirely|fully} {understand|realize|know} now
what {my professor|the professor of mine} was {saying|thinking} {about|approximately|roughly} {people who|individuals who|people that} {get|become} {really|definitely} {into|to} {their music|the music of theirs}, when I {saw|watched} the oboe {player|participant|professional} {in the|within the|inside the} {front|forward} play {his solo|the solo of his} with {{passion|enthusiasm|commitment} {and|as well as|and also} {skill|ability|experience|talent|knowledge} |{skill|ability|experience|talent|knowledge} {and|as well as|and also} {passion|enthusiasm|commitment}}. {There is|There's} {no doubt|little doubt} {that|which} the oboe {and|and also|in addition to being} flute
