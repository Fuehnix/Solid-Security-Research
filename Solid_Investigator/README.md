The Solid Spintax Investigator is a command-line utility to identify documents generated by the Solid Spintax Spintaxer. Spintaxes are built according to the [Solid Spintax standard](https://github.com/SolidSecurity/Solid-Spintax-Specification), which is backwards-compatible with standard spintax.

The spintaxer used to generate the permutations being investigated is completely deterministic &mdash; every possible permutation of a document is given a unique identifier. The unique identifier generated by the Solid Spintax Spinner is used by the Investigator to determine edit distances, and most likely leaker.

## Installation
### Bash Script
If you are just looking to get up and running with the spintaxer as quickly as possible, you can run these two commands to download the latest Solid Spintaxer and create an alias for you automatically:

```
git clone https://github.com/SolidSecurity/Solid-Spintax-Investigator.git
echo "alias investigator='java -jar $PWD/Solid-Spintax-Spinner/dist/Solid-Spintax-Spinner.jar'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Download
#### (Recommended) Download Release
Download the latest release as a .zip containing required dependencies along with an executable .jar file from our [release page](https://github.com/SolidSecurity/Solid-Spintax-Specification/releases).

#### (Alternative) Build from Source
The repository also contains NetBeans project files for those who wish to make modifications and then build the repository themselves.

### Running
#### Command Line
You can run dist/SolidSpintaxSpinner.jar directly from the command line with the following comand (after cloning the repository into the current directory):

`java -jar Solid-Spintax-Investigator/dist/Solid-Spintax-Investigator.jar <input.sstx> [-arguments]`

#### (Optional) Create Alias
Optionally, create an alias for the installed command like so:

`echo "alias investigator='java -jar $PWD/Solid-Spintax-Spinner/dist/Solid-Spintax-Spinner.jar'" >> ~/.bashrc`

The spinner can then be run directly using:

`investigator <spintax_file> <leaked_document> <tag_database> [-arguments]`

## Help
Use the `-h` or `--help` to get a shortened version of the help information below:

### Usage
The spinner accepts an input file and a set of arguments:

`investigator [-a <ALGO>] [-sc <int>] [-ic <int>] [-dc <int>] [-d <FILE>] [-v] [-h] [<FILE>] [<FILE>] [<FILE>] `



## Options

### Modes

#### Algorithms

Specity in what ways the investigator determines the leak source, the Algorithm Options are CosineDistance, HammingDistance, JaccardDistance, JaroWinklerDistance, LevenshteinDistance, LevenshteinDetailedDistance, LongestCommonSubsequenceDistance.

`-a <ALGO>, --algorithm <ALGO>`: sets the algorithm 

#### Costs

LevenshteinDetailedDistance uses three cost paramaters to determine edit distance. They are insertion cost, deletion cost, and subsitution cost. They are all one by default, at which point the LevenshteinDetailedDistance algorithm behaves like a standard LevenshteinDistance. Any combination of these can be used at any time.

`-ic <#>, --insertion-cost <#>` : Sets the insertion cost, every insertion now costs <#>

`-dc <#>, --deletion-cost <#>`: Sets the deletion cost, every deletion now costs <#>

`-sc <#>, --substitution-cost <#>`: Sets the substitution cost, every substitution now costs <#>



### Output

Specify where output files should be stored

`-d <FILE>, --data <FILE>`: creates a  separate  file  with modelling data.

Creates a log file mapping usernames and tags to edit distances from the
